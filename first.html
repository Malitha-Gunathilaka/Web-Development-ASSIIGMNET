<p> <i> <b>Aquilaria </b></i> and <i><b> Gyrinops</b> </i> are genera of tropical trees <br/> that produce a valuable resinous
wood called <b>agarwood</b>.<br/> The aromatic properties of agarwood when burned or distilled
are <br/> extraordinary and <br/>there is high demand for the resinous wood to make incense,<br/> make
perfume <br/> and <br/>as traditional medicine.

 <hr/><b>Theodore Lyman</b>founded the series between 1906 and 1914. As a result,
it is named for him. According to Bohr’s concept, the Lyman series appears when
electrons shift from higher energy levels (nh = 2,3,4,5,6,…) to nl = 1 energy state. The
wavelengths of the Lyman series are all in the ultraviolet range.<br/><hr/>
The series was discovered in the year 1885 by <b>Johann Balmer.</b> Thus the series is
named after him.
Balmer series is displayed when electron transition takes place from higher energy
states(nh=3,4,5,6,7,…) to nl=2 energy state.<br/><hr/>
The series was first observed in 1922 by American physicist <b>Friedrich Sumner
Brackett.</b> Thus the series is named after him. Brackett series is displayed when electron
transition takes place from higher energy states(nh=5,6,7,8,9…) to nl=4 energy state.
